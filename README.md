### pyxhook

pyxhook is an implementation of pyhook (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyhook/) that works on Linux

It is 100% desktop and GUI toolkit independent. It is taken from: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pykeylogger/

The purpose of this repository is to provide a central location for obtaining just pyxhook.py library and provide a clear example of its usage.

The script can be used now as a package installed via pip in the target environment, or by extracting the code in:
/src/pyxhook/pyxhook.py and copying to a location you desire.
