#    Thanks to Alex Badea <vamposdecampos@gmail.com> for writing the Record
#    demo for the xlib libraries. It helped me immensely working with these
#    in this library.
#
#    Thanks to the python-xlib team. This wouldn't have been possible without
#    your code.
#    
#    This requires: 
#    at least python-xlib 1.4
#    xwindows must have the "record" extension present, and active.

#    So if there are any bugs, they are probably my fault. :)
